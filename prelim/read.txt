Goal: 

Test to what extent the a cnn can identify the task/obj based on a given observation
    
    - Identify tasks regardless of obs size
    
    - Differentiate between tasks whos obs shape are identical
    
    - Identify tasks regardless of obs position


Outcome:

    - The model was able to identify the task regardless of the obs size
    
    - The model was able to differentiate between tasks whos obs shape are identical some of the time


Takeaway:

    - Although the model inconsistently identified tasks with identical obs shapes, it was able 
        to identify tasks regardless of obs size and position

    - The CNN architecture used takes a vector of variable size but reduces the ouput between each convolution to
        maintain dimensionality for the fully connected layer. When classifiying tasks with identical obs shapes the model may have
        difficulty differentiating between tasks, since the maxpooling reduces information in a way the rainbow net does not.
